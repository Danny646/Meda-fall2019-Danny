<h1>Hello Welcome to my portfolio pg</h1>  
 <h2> </h2> Eveyone I hope you enjoy this! 
 <p> I designed sites with WordPress, joomla and used them as templates as well as open source forums as well as Drupaland those open sources you can use them as a osting service. 
 My idea for a creating this site is not to create your site as glitz and glamour and pull on the glamour taks and or a highly audio site aas well as visual but it overcompensate  for a genuine good site, so that's what I want to make. 
 A site to help people, show experinces of what portfolio you did.    I got into 3d animation , worked with an image applications Firefox, Dreamweaver. I think writing a blog about gluten free foods  would be good since it can help people , who are strugiling to find out about it 
 <p> I am trying to get into the media world but for now I am looking to create a basic site that eventually is  a standard in w3c.  I am exited to ventiure into the media world, knowing it's not going to be easy,
